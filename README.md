## Abstract
Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade across solid tumors1–3, but their impact on tumor-specific T cell responses remains incompletely defined. By tracking the spatial phenotype of T cell clones with confirmed anti-tumor specificity, we report the architecture of T cell responses in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Across 24 RCC tumors, TLS-containing (TLS+) tumors were more infiltrated by exhausted CD8 T cells, but with a reduced terminal exhaustion transcriptional program compared to TLS- tumors. To investigate the effect of TLS localization on RCC-specific T cells, we screened 581 CD8+ and CD4+ T cell receptor (TCR) α/β pairs across six patients and identified 72 tumor-specific (TS) and 21 tumor-antigen-specific TCRs. Among these bona fide TS-TCR clonotypes, 45.8% of clonotypes infiltrated tumors, and 10.2% localized within TLS by spatial transcriptomics. TS-TCRs in TLS+ tumors preferentially colocalized with plasma cell transcripts (P<0.0001) compared to viral-reactive TCRs, and were associated with upregulated progenitor exhausted. However, in counterbalance, exhausted TCR clonotypes also colocalized with macrophages of inferred immunosuppressive phenotype concentrated within a myeloid boundary of the tumor (P=3x10-14). Our data reveal TLS as reservoirs of tumor-specific T cells with stem-like features that could be leveraged by T cell immunotherapies.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8c52ee4-0672-4c7b-82b9-2d68455d28e3)
